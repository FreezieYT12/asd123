    <dealershipinfo1>
      In Statutory Roleplay one of the many things we offer the ability<br>
      to own your own car dealership, for example, this is Freezies Chevrolet<br>
       dealership. As a dealership owner, you will have to first, buy the dealership<br>
      obvously. Then you have to make sure you have enough money for the cars that<br>
      your going to be selling in your dealership because, you have to pay to buy<br>
      the cars to put them into stock. But don't worry, you can hire employees to do<br>
      the simple things like that for you, and they get comission per car that they<br>
      deliver to the dealership, so you don't have to worry about direct payment.<br>
